## 🎯 Objective

Compare the risk and return profiles of **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)** using historical price data to empirically demonstrate the risk–return tradeoff in cryptocurrency markets.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Metric | Bitcoin (BTC) | Ethereum (ETH) |
|---|---|---|
| Cumulative Return | ~300% | ~608% |
| Annualized Volatility | Lower | Higher |
| Correlation (Pearson) | — | ~0.85 with BTC |
| Risk Profile | Moderate | High |

- **Ethereum delivered ~608% cumulative return** — significantly outperforming Bitcoin over the same period
- **Higher returns came with higher volatility**, confirming the classic risk–return tradeoff
- **Strong positive correlation (~0.85)** between BTC and ETH suggests they move together in macro market cycles
- BTC shows more **price stability**, making it comparatively lower risk for long-term holders

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Usage |
|---|---|
| **Python** | Core analysis language |
| **Pandas** | Data cleaning, transformation, time-series manipulation |
| **NumPy** | Returns calculation, volatility, statistical metrics |
| **Matplotlib / Seaborn** | Visualizations (returns, volatility, correlation heatmap) |
| **SQLite + sqlite3** | Structured querying, aggregation, and filtering |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | Interactive analysis and visualization |

## 📊 Analysis Breakdown

### 1. Data Retrieval
- Historical OHLCV data retrieved via **yFinance API**
- BTC: 10 years of data | ETH: 8 years of data
- Data cleaned: null values removed, dates parsed, columns standardized

### 2. Returns Analysis
- Computed **daily returns** using `pct_change()`
- Calculated **cumulative returns** to measure overall growth
- Compared total return: ETH (~608%) vs BTC (~300%)

### 3. Volatility Analysis
- Computed **annualized volatility** using rolling standard deviation × √252
- ETH consistently showed higher volatility than BTC across all periods

### 4. Correlation Analysis
- **Pearson correlation matrix** computed between BTC and ETH daily returns
- Strong positive correlation confirmed — both assets are affected by the same macro crypto market forces

### 5. SQL Analysis (SQLite)
- Loaded processed data into SQLite database
- Queried yearly average prices, best/worst performing months, and comparative summaries
